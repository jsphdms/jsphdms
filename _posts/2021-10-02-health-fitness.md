- **[Redefining Strength](https://www.youtube.com/user/redefiningstrengthOC)**: bodyweight, cardio, and flexibility
- **[Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0DZhN-8KFLYO6beSaYljg)**: bodyweight and flexibility
- **[Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithadriene)**: yoga
- **[DoYogaWithMe](https://www.youtube.com/c/doyogawithme)**: yoga
