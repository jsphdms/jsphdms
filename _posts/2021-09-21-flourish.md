The subtitle and two-part structure imply an instructional element. For a book on this topic from this author, I hoped for something like:
- what is flourishing
- how to achieve it
- an organised arrangement of exercises
  - discussion of the evidence behind their recommendation
  - how those activities fit within the PERMA framework

This book is actually mostly a collection of stories about the last 10 years of the author's career:
- the projects he's worked on
- the people he's met
- general praise of positive psychology and how it should be taught in institutions like schools and the military

On the positive side, there is some discussion defining flourishing and it's component PERMA parts. There is also a modest number of exercises. Although they mainly serve the stories; so they're rather light on evidence and are placed fairly randomly throughout the book.

So far, the best evidence-based and practical advice I've found on wellbeing are [5 steps to mental wellbeing](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/five-steps-to-mental-wellbeing/) from the NHS. These steps were based on [Five Ways to Wellbeing](https://neweconomics.org/2008/10/five-ways-to-wellbeing) by the New Economics Foundation.
