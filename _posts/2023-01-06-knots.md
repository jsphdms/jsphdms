In 2022 I tried out hammock camping and learned two things:
- [The Pentlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentland_Hills) don't have many trees :(
- There are lots of [ways to hang a hammock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahaAdtfX9ZJ8QsJqWwRN4_MaZ8UAyzWm)

Over about seven camping trips, I experimented with different kinds of materials and knots. It really captured my imagination that, with some knowledge and skill, a simple piece of material can be so versatile.

If I had to give a single tip to the average person for knot tying, it would be to stop using the [overhand knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/overhand-knot) and start using the [figure eight knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) (I explain why in the first row in the table below).

## Lists of knots
Some organisations have semi-official lists of knots:
- The International Guild of Knot Tyers lists these families of [knots and splices](https://igkt.net/knotting-basics/37-what-are-knots-and-splices)
- The Scouts list a few [knots for pioneering](https://www.scouts.org.uk/activities/knot-your-average-pioneer/)
- The Royal National Lifeboat Institution blogs about [three of the nine knots](https://rnli.org/magazine/magazine-featured-list/2014/december/tie-3-knots-like-a-lifeboat-crew-member) lifeboat crew members have to know (the other six are a mystery to me!)

Many individuals list their favourite knots too:
- Dave Root lists [The Most Useful Rope Knots for the Average Person to Know](https://daveroot.neocities.org/knots/)
- Andy's [Most Useful Knots](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/cr_most-useful-knots.html)
- Hammock forums member Rat lists their [Essential Outdoor Knots](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php/70824-Essential-Outdoor-Knots-according-to-Rat!)

## My favourite knots for hammock camping
These are the knots I like the most so far, with the best tutorials I've found so far. Most of the tutorials I've picked are from [Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com/). "ABOK" stands for Ashley Book of Knots. So ABOK #1249 means knot number 1249 in that book.

| Type | Name | Notes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Stopper | [Figure eight](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) | Quick and non-binding. You can build on this knot to create bends, loops, and hitches. |
| Binding knot | [Constrictor knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/constrictor-knot-rope-end-method) | A very secure binding knot. |
| Hitch | [Cow hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/cow-hitch-knot-loops-method) | I use these to attach webbing to a tree to suspend a hammock from. It's very easy to untie and gives me twice as much webbing for extra strength. Although it does make it bulkier to pack away. |
| Hitch | [Marlinspike hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/marlinspike-hitch-knot) | This can be used to create a rope ladder. I use them to attach my hammock suspension to tree webbing and to attach guy lines to tent pegs or walking poles. A nice feature is that the cord pulls on opposite ends of the spike. <br /> <br />Ashley says that ABOK #1191 is more likely to stay in place when the cord slackens. Although I've found it tricky to tie if it's cold and windy, or if I'm using small diameter cord. Also I can't find a tutorial for ABOK #1191 online, so let me know if you've seen one(!) |
| Hitch | [Siberian hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/siberian-hitch-knot) | I use this quick release hitch to attach a ridgeline to a tree to support a tarpaulin. It's very similar to a figure eight knot. At the other end of the ridgeline you want a tensioning knot to pull the ridgeline taught. Two options are: [DD Hammock's technique](https://youtu.be/BKJdhjxFmxA?t=580) and a [trucker's hitch](https://youtu.be/T8dUP_xGa3g?t=54). The loop in the trucker's hitch is a marlinspike. |
| Bend | [Sheet Bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/sheet-bend-knot) | Join two cords easily. Note how this is identical in structure to the bowline. If the cords are of a different size, use the thicker cord for the simple bight. |
| Bend | [Carrick Bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/carrick-bend-knot) | In ABOK #1439, Ashley says this "... is perhaps the nearest thing we have to a perfect bend. It is symmetrical, it is easy to tie, it does not slip easily in wet material, it is among the strongest of knots, it cannot jam and is readily untied. To offset this array of excellencies is the sole objection that it is somewhat bulky." |
| Mid loop | [Alpine Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLvUe6Ofz4) | Mid loops can also be used as bends. |
| End loop | [Bowline](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot) | Tie the 'King of the knots' with this mnemonic: [up through the rabbit hole, round the big tree; down through the rabbit hole and off goes he](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline#Tying). I use these to cow hitch guy lines to a tarpaulin.  |
| Slide and grip | [Blakeâ€™s Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/blakes-hitch-knot) | I find this works well when hitching shock cord to paracord. |
| Slide and grip | [Prusik Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/prusik-knot) | I find this works well when hitching paracord to paracord. |
| Splice | [Soft shackle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0eZz36PRYI) | I use these as a lighter alternative to a carabiner for hammock suspension. |
| Splice | [Whoopie sling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRuiTrR4KQA) | I use these as a light suspension system for hammocks. An alternative that is even lighter is the Utility Constrictor Rope (UCR). Although these are more likely to slip without further adaptations to keep the finger trap mechanism under tension. | 
| Decorative | [Chain Sinnet](https://www.animatedknots.com/chain-sinnet-knot) | Tidy up loose cord while keeping it very easy to deploy. |
| Decorative | [Hank](https://youtu.be/NIdXKw3sH7Y?t=13) | Store cord while keeping it easy to deploy. I usually add a bowline before following these instructions to make it more obvious where to pull from. |
| Shoelace knot | [Ian knot](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm) | The "World's Fastest Shoelace Knot". I find this handy if I'm taking my shoes on and off a lot. |
