The Guardian has an excellent article on [how to cook perfect porridge](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/10/how-to-cook-perfect-porridge). The secret is constant stirring. I use oatmeal or oat bran because they cook faster than oats. They're also higher in protein and fibre than normal oats; especially oat bran.

| ingredient          | measure           |
|:--------------------|:------------------|
| oatmeal / oat bran  | 2 tablespoons     |
| plant milk          |                   |
| mixed nuts          |                   |
| mixed seeds         |                   |
| prunes              |                   |
| cinnamon            |                   |

1. put everything in a pan
1. stir constantly while bringing to boil
1. simmer and keep stirring until the consistency changes
1. take off the heat; it will thicken as it cools
