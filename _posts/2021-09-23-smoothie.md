## Medium smoothie (just over a pint)

I developed this over a few months of experimentation to get something I liked. It also ticks a fair few boxes in the [daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/).

| ingredient     | measure      |
|:---------------|:-------------|
| banana         | 1            |
| plant milk     |              |
| spinach frozen |              |
| berries        |              |
| flax seeds     | 1 tablespoon |
| psyllium husk  | 1 tablespoon |


## Big smoothie (almost a litre)
