## Medium smoothie 1.0 (just over a pint)

I developed this over a few months of experimentation to get something I liked. It also ticks a fair few boxes in the [daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/).

| ingredient     | measure      |
|:---------------|:-------------|
| banana         | 1            |
| plant milk     |              |
| spinach frozen |              |
| berries        |              |
| flax seeds     | 1 tablespoon |
| psyllium husk  | 1 tablespoon |

## Medium smoothie 2.0 (just over a pint)

Spinach is a [high oxilate green](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/kidney-stones-and-spinach-chard-and-beet-greens-dont-eat-too-much/) so I swapped the spinach for kale and purple cabbage (lower oxilate and both cruciferous vegetables).

I also:
- added peanut butter (for nuts)
- removed psyllium husk (no nutrition)
- removed berries (personal preference)
