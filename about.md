I've been known to do these things voluntarily:
- **Run**: usually between 5 and 10 km with the [occasional parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=2514189)
- **Read**: my favourite author is probably Stanislaw Lem
- **Eat**: I've been on the [daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/) since around summer 2020
- **Meditate**: I have an on-off practice and go on the occasional retreat
- **Write**: I've started writing the occasional letter and zoom quiz
- **Sleep**: Mostly in the evenings
